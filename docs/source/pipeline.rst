Pipeline
========
Pre-requisite softwares
-------------------

To run the pipeline successfully one needs to install/download several third-party tools.
Before going into the installation procedure. We should go over the actual input format. 
The input folder contains the raw sequencing reads. 

The operation starts from the ``BASECALLS_DIR``, that contains the actual intensities and the 
``bcl`` files. For example the basic structure of such file will be 

::

        âžœslide-seq-pipeline git:(main) ls /home/hsarkar/code/slide-seq-data/P25255/220329_A00689_0513_BHYK23DRXY/
        Config            InterOp                 Recipe           RunInfo.xml        SequenceComplete.txt
        CopyComplete.txt  Logs                    RTA3.cfg         runParameters.xml  Thumbnail_Images
        Data              P25255_SampleSheet.txt  RTAComplete.txt  RunParameters.xml


The ``bcl`` files are present in ``Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/``.  The ``RunInfo.xml`` used to be the file
that has the information that is to be parsed before writing down the information.

Use the existing `package <https://github.com/MacoskoLab/slideseq-tools>`_ so that we can import existing structures 
from the ``slideseq-tools``. 

Install existing ``slideseq-tools`` package 
::

        >git clone https://github.com/MacoskoLab/slideseq-tools.git

Create a spread-sheet that contains some of the following fields that we need to feel.
