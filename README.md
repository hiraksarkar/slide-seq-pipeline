# slide-seq-pipeline
This is pipeline replicate most of the stuff provided in (official slide-seq)[https://github.com/MacoskoLab/slideseq-tools] except 
the dependence to the google sheet and assumed internal file/folder location. We lack some of the generalization as these scripts 
are meant to run on a local machine. I would highly recoment installing the actual package since some of the functions are directly used 
in this repo. 


The documentation for the pipeline is available [here](https://slide-seq-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
